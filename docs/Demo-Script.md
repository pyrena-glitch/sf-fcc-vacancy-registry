---

## Part 1: The Problem We're Solving (2 min)

### Opening

> "Thanks for taking the time to look at this with me. I want to show you something we've been building to help FCC providers like you.
>
> Right now, when families are looking for childcare, they have to call around, check multiple websites, or rely on word of mouth. And for providers, there's no easy way to let families know when you have openings.
>
> This platform changes that. It's a simple way for you to report your vacancies, and for families to find you."

---

## Part 2: What Families See (3 min)

### Show the Public Listings Page

> "Let me show you what families see when they're looking for childcare."

**Walk through:**

1. **The main search page**
   > "This is where families start. They can see all FCC providers in San Francisco who have reported openings."

2. **The filters**
   > "Families can filter by neighborhood, age group, language, and schedule. So if a family needs infant care in the Mission with Spanish spoken, they can find exactly that."

3. **Click on a listing to expand**
   > "When they click on a program, they see the details - contact info, what ages you're accepting, schedule options. They can call or email you directly."

4. **Point out ELFA badge (if applicable)**
   > "ELFA network members get this yellow badge, so families know you're part of that quality network."

**Key point:**
> "The goal is to make it easy for families to find you when you have space available."

## Part 3: Provider Sign-In (2 min)

### Show the Sign-In Process

> "Now let me show you how you'd use this as a provider."

**Walk through:**

1. **Click "Report your vacancies"**
   > "You click here to sign in. You can use Google or create an account with your email."

2. **License verification (explain, don't need to demo)**
   > "The first time you sign in, you'll enter your license number. The system verifies it automatically - this keeps the registry trustworthy, only real licensed providers."

3. **Profile setup (explain)**
   > "Then you fill out your basic info - business name, location, contact info, languages you speak. You only do this once."

---

## Part 4: Reporting Vacancies (3 min)

### Show the Vacancy Form

> "This is the main thing you'll use - reporting your vacancies."

**Walk through:**

1. **Age group spots**
   > "You just enter how many spots you have available in each age group. Infant, toddler, preschool, school age."

2. **Schedule options**
   > "Check whether you have full-time, part-time, or both available."

3. **Waitlist checkbox**
   > "This is important - even if you're full, check this box if you accept waitlist signups. Families planning ahead can still find you and reach out."

4. **Submit**
   > "Click update, and you're done. Your listing is now live for families to see."

**Key point:**
> "The whole thing takes less than a minute. When a spot opens up or fills, you just come back and update the numbers."

---

## Part 5: Roster & Projections (3 min) - Optional

*Only show this if the provider seems interested in more features*

### Show the Roster Tab

> "There's also a roster feature that can help you plan ahead."

**Walk through:**

1. **Add children (show how simple it is)**
   > "You can add children to track who's enrolled. You don't even need to enter names - just the date of birth is enough. We keep it simple for privacy."

2. **Age calculations**
   > "The system automatically calculates their age and which group they're in."

3. **Projections**
   > "And here's the useful part - it shows you when children will age into the next group, or when they'll leave for kindergarten. So you can see openings coming before they happen."

4. **Auto-fill**
   > "You can even auto-fill your vacancy form based on your roster. It calculates how many spots you have available."

**Key point:**
> "This part is optional, but providers who use it say it helps them plan ahead."

## Part 6: Wrap Up & Feedback Request (2 min)

### Closing

> "That's basically it. Simple to use - report your vacancies, families find you.
>
> We're in beta testing right now, which means we're still improving it based on what providers like you tell us.
>
> **I'd love to hear:**
> - What challenges do you face with managing vacancies and enrollment?
> - Is there anything you wish this could do that it doesn't?
> - Any questions about how it works?
>
> Your feedback helps us make this better for everyone. You can email me anytime at oscar.fccasf@gmail.com."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this free?**
> "Yes, completely free for providers."

**Q: Who can see my information?**
> "Only the business info you enter - business name, contact info, vacancy numbers. Families can't see your roster or personal details."

**Q: How often should I update?**
> "Whenever your availability changes. If a spot fills or opens up, just log in and update the numbers. Takes 30 seconds."

**Q: What if I'm completely full?**
> "You can still be listed! Set spots to 0 and check 'Waitlist available.' Families planning ahead can still find you and contact you about your waitlist."

**Q: Is this connected to the state licensing?**
> "We verify your license number to make sure only real licensed providers are listed, but we don't report anything to the state. This is just to help families find you."

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
> "Yes, it works on mobile. You can update your vacancies from anywhere."
