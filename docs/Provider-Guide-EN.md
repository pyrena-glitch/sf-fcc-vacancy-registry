### Report Vacancies
Tell families about your available spots:
- **By age group**: Infant (under 2), Toddler (2-3), Preschool (3-5), School Age (6+)
- **Schedule options**: Full-time, Part-time, or both
- **Availability date**: When spots open up
- **Waitlist**: Let families know you accept waitlist signups even when full

### Roster Management
Track your enrolled children (optional but helpful):
- Add children with just their date of birth (names are optional for privacy)
- The system automatically calculates ages and age groups
- See upcoming openings as children age out or transition to kindergarten
- Auto-fill your vacancy form based on your roster

### Capacity Projections
Plan ahead with automatic calculations:
- See when children will transition between age groups
- Know when spots will open due to kindergarten starts
- California infant ratio compliance is built-in

---

## Reporting as "Full"

If you have no current openings:
- Set all spots to 0
- Check "Waitlist available" if you accept waitlist signups
- Your program will appear in the "Currently Full" section
- Families can still contact you to join your waitlist

---

## Tips for Providers

1. **Keep your listing updated** - Families rely on accurate information
2. **Update when things change** - New opening? Child leaving? Update right away
3. **Use the roster feature** - It helps predict future openings automatically
4. **Check the "Waitlist" box** - Even when full, families want to plan ahead
